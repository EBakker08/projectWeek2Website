                    <p>In "Colour Scape" you are a character named Axo. Axo is an axolotl who is lost in a different demention where you can switch colours when touching them.</p>
                    <p>Not only does Axo have to find a way back to his own dimension. He also has to avoid enemies and obstacles on his path and collect fruits to stay alive.</p>
                    <p>To find his way back home, Axo first has to collect all colour hexagons found scattered throughout the world.</p>

                <h2>Gameplay aspects</h2>
                <div class="additional-text-game">
                    <p>In "Colour Scape" you have to find the best and most efficient path to get to the finish line. Throughout the levels you will be able to switch between different colours. When a colour is selected you can interact with objects and platforms with the same colour as the character "Axo".</p>
                    <p>"Colour Scape" is a singleplayer speedrunner game with a unique twist on the genre. Througout the levels there are also collectables you can collect for extra fun.</p>
                    <p>If you like the idea you can soon try the demo on itch.io!</p>

                <div class="additional-text-game">
                    <p>Before we could begin development we had to know what we wanted to create. After that we had to make our assets and how you would play the game. During this time we also decided on the name "Colour Scape".</p>
                    <p>We used Godot Engine to create our game. Godot uses GDScript which is simular to Python. Using Godot was a whole new thing for us, but we got the hang of it and were able to create a demo for "Colour Scape" which will be available soon on itch.io.</p>

        <h2>Why you should play it</h2>
        <div class="reason">
            <div class="reason-text">
                <p>Because "Colour Scape" is a unique and fun game with a fresh take on the platformer and speerunning genre. The game is for all ages and is a great way to pass the time.</p>
